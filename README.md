This project aims to perform an analysis of Netflix, a popular streaming service. By analyzing the available data, we will gain insights into various aspects of Netflix, such as its content library, user preferences, and overall trends. The analysis will help us understand the types of movies and TV shows available on Netflix, examine user ratings and reviews, identify popular content, investigate viewership patterns, and answer specific questions about the dataset.

The questions we will address in this analysis are as follows:

1. **Identify Duplicate Records**: Is there any duplicate record in this dataset? If yes, then remove the duplicate records.
2. **Detect Null Values**: Is there any Null value present in any column? Show with a heat map.
3. **Show Information about 'House of Cards'**: For the show 'House of Cards', what is the Show ID and who is the Director?
4. **Analyze Release Years**: In which year were the highest number of TV shows and movies released? Show with a bar graph.
5. **Explore Movie and TV Show Counts**: How many movies and TV shows are in the dataset? Show with a bar graph.
6. **Filter Movies Released in 2000**: Show all the movies that were released in the year 2000.
7. **Filter US TV Shows**: Show only the titles of TV shows that were released in the US only.
8. **Ratings Analysis**:
   - Q. 8.1: What are the different Ratings defined by Netflix?
   - Q. 8.2: How many movies got the 'TV-14' rating in Canada? How many TV shows got the 'R' rating after the year 2018?
